/**
 * There's an undirected connected graph with n nodes labeled 1..n. But some of the edges has been broken disconnecting the graph. Find the minimum cost to repair the edges so that all the nodes are once again accessible from each other.

Input:

n, an int representing the total number of nodes.
edges, a list of integer pair representing the nodes connected by an edge.
edgesToRepair, a list where each element is a triplet representing the pair of nodes between which an edge is currently broken and the cost of repearing that edge, respectively (e.g. [1, 2, 12] means to repear an edge between nodes 1 and 2, the cost would be 12).
Example 1:

Input: n = 5, edges = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [4, 5], [1, 5]], edgesToRepair = [[1, 2, 12], [3, 4, 30], [1, 5, 8]]
Output: 20
Explanation:
There are 3 connected components due to broken edges: [1], [2, 3] and [4, 5].
We can connect these components into a single component by repearing the edges between nodes 1 and 2, and nodes 1 and 5 at a minimum cost 12 + 8 = 20.
Example 2:

Input: n = 6, edges = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [4, 5], [3, 5], [1, 6], [2, 4]], edgesToRepair = [[1, 6, 410], [2, 4, 800]]
Output: 410
Example 3:

Input: n = 6, edges = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [4, 5], [5, 6], [1, 5], [2, 4], [3, 4]], edgesToRepair = [[1, 5, 110], [2, 4, 84], [3, 4, 79]]
Output: 79

 * 1. Sort the edges according to repair cost.
2. Apply union find algorithm to see wether we can add an edge or not, 
the condition to add an edge if it's not belong to existing connected component.
3. Basically we check this condition in Kruskal algorithm to
 get the minimum spanning tree.
