5.1 Insertion:
You are given two 32-bit numbers, N and M, and two bit positions, i and j.
Write a method to insert M into N such that M starts at bit j and ends at bit i.
You can assume that the bits j through i have enough space to fit all of M.
That is,
if M = 10011, you can assume that there are at least 5 bits between j and i.
You would not, for example, have j = 3 and i = 2, because M could not fully fit between bit 3 and bit 2.

EXAMPLE
Input: N 10000000000, M =10011, i = 2, j = 6
Output: N = 10001001100
Hints: #137, #769, #215

5.2 Binary to String:
Given a real number between O and 1 (e.g., 0.72) that is passed in as a double,
print the binary representation.
If the number cannot be represented accurately in binary with at most 32 characters, print "ERROR:'
Hints: #743, #767, #7 73, #269, #297

5.3 Flip Bit to Win:
You have an integer and you can flip exactly one bit from a 0 to a 1.
Write code to find the length of the longest sequence of 1's you could create.
EXAMPLE
Input: 1775
Output: 8 (or: 11011101111)
Hints: #759, #226, #374, #352

5.4 Next Number:
Given a positive integer, print the next smallest and the next largest number that
have the same number of 1 bits in their binary representation.
Hints: #747, #7 75, #242, #372, #339, #358, #375, #390

5.5 Debugger:
Explain what the following code does: ( ( n & ( n-1)) == 0).
Hints:#757,#202,#267,#302,#346,#372,#383,#398

5.6 Conversion:
Write a function to determine the number of bits you would need to flip to convert
integer A to integer B.
EXAMPLE
Input: 29 (or: 11101), 15 (or: 01111)
Output: 2
Hints: #336, #369

5.7 Pairwise Swap:
Write a program to swap odd and even bits in an integer with as few instructions as
possible (e.g., bit 0 and bit 1 are swapped, bit 2 and bit 3 are swapped, and so on).
Hints: #745, #248, #328, #355

5.8 Draw Line:
A monochrome screen is stored as a single array of bytes, allowing eight consecutive pixels to be stored in one byte.
The screen has width w, where w is divisible by 8 (that is, no byte will be split across rows).
The height of the screen, of course, can be derived from the length of the array
and the width. Implement a function that draws a horizontal line from (xl, y) to (x2, y).
The method signature should look something like:
drawline(byte[] screen, int width, int xl, int x2, int y)
