 * Insertion:
 * You are given two 32-bit numbers, N and M, and two bit positions, i and j.
 * Write a method to insert M into N such that M starts at bit j and ends at bit i.
 * You can assume that the bits j through i have enough space to fit all of M.
 *
 * That is, if M = 10011, you can assume that there are at least 5 bits between
 * j and i.
 * You would not, for example, have j = 3 and i = 2, because M could not fully
 * fit between bit 3 and bit 2.

 * 1. N should have its bits flushed out from j to i
