/* LeetCode | E | 237
 * Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA)
 * of two given nodes in the BST.
 *
 * The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as
 * the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants
 * (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).ï¿½
 *
 * Given binary search tree:  root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5]

Example 1:
Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
Output: 6
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.

Example 2:
Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself
             according to the LCA definition.

Note:
All of the nodes' values will be unique.
p and q are different and both values will exist in the BST.

/*
Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree.
In the worst case we might be visiting all the nodes of the binary tree.

Space Complexity: O(N). This is because the maximum amount of space utilized
by the recursion stack would be NN since the height of a skewed binary tree could be N.
