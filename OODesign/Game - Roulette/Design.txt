Roulette Program
This program simulates a game of roulette. It's designed to show how several OO techniques and how these can improve on a more traditional not completely-OO approach.
Traditional class-based approach
An example of a more standard approach:
wheel.h class that simulates a roulette wheel
wheel.cc implementation
roulette.cc code for playing a game
OO approach
Here's a more object-oriented approach. A class diagram shows all the classes used.


Here's the code

bet.h
bankroll.h
betfactory.h
roulette.h
bankroll.cc
betfactory.cc
roulette.cc
